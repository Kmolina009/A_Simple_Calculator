#Simple Calculator

# I want to build a calculator that will allow me to input two values

#prototype

     # + - / * ** could I write a square root operator?
#     #retrun answer
#     #if the user wants to cancel, then they should input quit
      # Otherwise, it will persist(loop?) 
#     #
# #Then input a the operator I want to use on said numbers

# #Then return said numbers
